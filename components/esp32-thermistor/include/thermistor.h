/**
 * @file thermistor.h
 * @brief API definitions for adc thermistor driver for ESP32.
 *
 * This component provides a means to interface with a thermistor connected 
 * to an analog digital channel of an esp32 processor using the Espressif IDF.
 *
 * The thermistor is part of a resistive divider, where one of its ends is 
 * connected to GND and the other to the digital analog channel plus the series 
 * resistor whose end is connected to 3.3 V.
 * 
 * The ADC initialization is carried out with the esp_adc_cal module which, 
 * with a series of functions, uses the ADC calibration values recorded in eFuse 
 * to linearize the response.
 * 
 * The raw reading of the resistive divisor voltage becomes mV with the 
 * esp_adc_cal_raw_to_voltage function, and since the supply voltage of the 
 * resistive divider (3.3v) is known, with simple mathematics, the value of 
 * the resistance of the thermistor is obtained.
 * 
 * To obtain the temperature, the simplified Steniarth's equation is applied, 
 * which uses a logarithm of the coefficient provided by the manufacturer of 
 * the thermistor to linerize it.
